# Busha Frontend test

## Requirements

Create the screens for a Busha MVP application.

| View              | Links                                                                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Account List  | [Issue](issues/account-list.md) • [Tests](src/tests/account-list.test.tsx)   |
| Add Account    | [Issue](issues/add-wallet.md) • [Tests](src/tests/add-wallet.test.tsx)       |

## Guidelines

- Satisfy the requirements using TypeScript and React.

- Make use of, but don't change, the dependencies in [`package.json`](package.json).

- Make use of, but don't change, the components in [`src/components/shared`](src/components/shared/index.ts). See examples in [`src/stories`](src/stories).

- Don't change the tests in [`src/tests`](src/tests).

## Submission

When the tests pass, and the UI resembles the figma design, archive your work in a `.zip` file and send it to bolaji@busha.co with your CV. _Do not include `node_modules` in the `.zip` file._
