# Busha Frontend test completed
## Get Started

  -clone the repo

  -yarn install
  
  -yarn start

##### What was done:

* Complete screens (Including Design & Functionality) for Busha MVP application

##### How should it be tested:
* Browser: http://localhost:3000/
    * Production: https://busha-frontend-test-five.vercel.app/ 
* UI against figma
* yarn test

##### Please note:
* It'd be preferable to run this locally.
* I have configured ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES on vercel.
* I couldn't make use of the fonts used on the figma design because its not free online.
* Failed a couple of tests cases ðŸ™‚, but I'm still figuring it out.
